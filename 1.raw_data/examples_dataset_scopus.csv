It is one of the most important managerial issues in the protected areas of India, which are home to most of the floral and faunal biodiversity of country. This study examines the intricate relationship between livestock grazing and factors within the Pench Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra, focusing on the extent of grazing and its correlations with socio-ecological variables. We performed Spearman’s rank, Pearson, and Kendall’s Tau correlation tests, coupled with fixed kernel density analysis, and gathered empirical insights into grazing patterns. Results reveal that 15.33% of the total area of the PTR, and 9.12% of its core area, is subject to livestock grazing. Correlation analyses unveil nuanced associations between grazing and demographic variables. While the number of families and livestock numbers inversely correlate with grazing within the core, the percentage of tribal population exhibits a positive correlation, underscoring socio-cultural dimensions of grazing practices. Furthermore, environmental parameters such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and elevation exhibit significant correlations with grazing patterns, indicating ecological preferences and constraints. This study highlights the critical need for holistic management strategies that factor in socio-demographic dynamics and stakeholder engagement in forest management activities for sustainable conservation practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Indian Landscape; Human-wildlife Conflict; Livestock Grazing; Protected Areas; Tiger Reserve","","",NA,"Springer Nature",27319431,NA,"",NA,"English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000756899"

In urban systems, management strategies to reduce human-wildlife interactions could also alter wildlife movement and distribution, with potential effects on key ecological processes such as pathogen spread. Methods: To better understand how management actions interact with existing spatial dynamics to mediate wildlife movement patterns, we experimentally subjected urban-nesting yellow-legged gulls to induced breeding failure via egg-oiling. We then followed their movements using bird-borne GPS transmitters throughout the treatment season as well as the following annual cycle and compared them to the movements of tracked gulls whose nests were not oiled, while also accounting for individual and temporal factors known to influence movement patterns including sex, body size, and breeding stage. Results: Gulls with oiled nests had smaller breeding-season home ranges, spent more time at breeding sites, made fewer foraging trips, and traveled shorter distances than gulls with non-oiled nests during the treatment season but not during the following breeding season. Gulls were partially migratory, with individuals showing a variety of migratory strategies from year-round residency to long-distance migration to inland urban centers. Although egg-oiling delayed the onset of post-breeding migration, individual migration strategies remaining consistent between years regardless of treatment. Antibody titres against three common pathogens varied among pathogens but not by migration distances or individual characteristics. Conclusions: Our results show that induced breeding failure via egg-oiling may have unintended short-term consequences including smaller home range areas, altered habitat use, delayed migration, and longer breeding-site residency, suggesting that management actions aimed to reduce breeding success could increase opportunities for human-wildlife conflict and spread of spatially heterogeneous pathogens at local scales. At the landscape scale, the migration patterns and wintering distribution of yellow-legged gulls are unlikely to be affected by egg-oiling. However, long-distance inland migrations of a portion of the population present a novel pathway for pathogen transmission between and among marine habitats and terrestrial human, livestock, and wildlife populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foraging; Frioul; Human-wildlife Conflict; Larus Michahellis; Mediterranean; Yellow-legged Gull","","This work was conducted under a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship to J.S.L. under the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 program (Project SENTIMOUV; H2020-MSCA-IF-2018 #843470), with additional funding from the Waterbird Society (Nisbet Research Award) and OSU OREME.",NA,"BioMed Central Ltd",20513933,NA,"",NA,"English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000341006"

Reducing deer populations by lethal means and facilitating return of large predators are two potential, but controversial, management options. We used an online questionnaire to measure perspectives on deer management and predator return among a stratified sample of New York State residents. We found widespread acceptance (> 70%) for reducing deer populations using lethal means if doing so would reduce Lyme disease, increase forest regeneration, protect native plants and animals, and improve road safety. Acceptance for shooting more deer was unaffected by ethnicity but strongest among respondents who were older, identified as hunters or conservationists, owned more land, and considered health and safety while answering our questionnaire. Respondents who identified as animal protectionists were least accepting. Restoring regionally extirpated wolves and cougars had limited acceptance (< 30%) but was strongest among those who identified as hunters or conservationists.

Area-based conservation measures, such as protected areas (PAs), employ different management strategies via land-use designations to mitigate anthropogenic pressures and reduce human-wildlife conflicts in shared landscapes. Here, we assessed carnivore diel activity and temporal activity overlap in and around El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve (REBITRI) in Chiapas, Mexico, along a land-use designation gradient. We deployed 33 camera traps along the gradient, leveraging the reserve’s core and buffer zones, and private lands surrounding the reserve. We calculated activity overlap between species to detect changes in interspecific competition and predator-prey interactions along the gradient. In total, we detected 14 carnivores in the core zones, 10 in the buffer zone, and 9 on private land across the 4777 trap-night survey. Significant shifts in single-species diel activity between the buffer zones and private land were detected for margay (Leopardus wiedii) and grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Activity overlap was the highest in the buffer zone for all predator-prey pairs, and two competitor pairs, suggesting reduced diel niche partitioning in this land-use designation due to varied anthropogenic pressures. Our findings contribute to assessing PA efficacy and understanding carnivore activity in multiple-use landscapes where anthropogenic pressures are ubiquitous. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diel Activity; Mammals; Mexico; Niche Overlap; Protected Areas; Animal; Carnivora; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Fox; Human; Mexico; Physiology; Predation; Procedures; Animals; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Foxes; Humans; Predatory Behavior","animal; Carnivora; ecosystem; environmental protection; fox; human; Mexico; physiology; predation; procedures; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Foxes; Humans; Predatory Behavior","We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our local field technicians (N.

Accurate estimates of these mortality rates are essential for developing effective management strategies to aid in the species’ recovery. This study enhances existing vessel strike models by incorporating detailed regional data on vessel traffic characteristics as well as whale distribution and behavior. Our model assesses the spatial and temporal variability in vessel strike risk along the U.S. east coast apportioned into three vessel length classes (26–65 feet, 65–350 feet, > 350 feet). By including regional right whale depth distributions and parameterizing potential whale avoidance based on factors such as descent rate, bottom depth, and vessel speed and size, the model provides a refined estimation of mortality risk. We also address the underrepresentation of smaller vessel activity via a correction factor, offering a more accurate annual mortality risk estimate for each vessel size class. These findings highlight that vessels > 350 feet in length pose the greatest risk to right whales. Simulations of reduced vessel speeds indicate that speed measures can mitigate mortality rates; however, residual risk remains even at speeds of 10 knots or less suggesting limitations to this mitigation approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conservation; Endangered Species; Human Wildlife Conflict; North Atlantic Right Whales; Risk Model; Vessel Strike; Animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; Endangered Species; Environmental Protection; Epidemiology; Physiology; Procedures; Ship; Theoretical Model; United States; Animals; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Models, Theoretical; Ships; Whales","animal; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; endangered species; environmental protection; epidemiology; physiology; procedures; ship; theoretical model; United States; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Models, Theoretical; Ships; Whales","Funding text 1: We thank several data contributors including Susan Parks, Doug Nowacek, Mark Baumgartner, and Daniel Engelhaupt for providing tag data to accurately assess right whale vertical spatial behavior by habitat region.

The study mapped five spatial risk zones, from very low to very high, and determined the effects of habitat changes on HLCI. Changes in land-use patterns, vegetation health, and anthropogenic activity have significant effects on hotspots of negative HLCI.

Despite increased research on Chinese dholes, no systematic effort has comprehensively reviewed the published literature or evaluated current knowledge of the species in China. Therefore, we reviewed available published papers to provide the following information on dholes in China: a) current population status and research progress; b) primary threats; and c) knowledge limitations and recommendations derived from the literature. Our findings show that confirmed dhole distribution records exist for only seven provinces, and records of dhole captive breeding and ex situ conservation in China over the last 10 years originate from only two wildlife conservation centers and six zoos. During 2015–2025, 48 articles focusing on dholes in China were identified, predominantly authored by Chinese scholars (98 %). Population distribution and number, genetics and phylogeny, and veterinary medicine are the three most frequent research topics. Persecution and poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, disease and pathogens, and competition with other species are major threats to Chinese dholes. Several limitations of conservation and research persist, including unclear population size and distribution status, scarce and unevenly distributed research, and a lack of systematic, comprehensive, and in-depth conservation efforts. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing rigorous surveys and vital research (e.g., on disease transmission and captive breeding feasibility).

While the broad patterns of the globally endangered black-and-chestnut eagle’s (Spizaetus isidori) feeding habits are known in the northern Andes, specific knowledge of the sex-related diet differences in the species remains unknown. Here, we conducted direct observations to evaluate the differences in prey size between female and male eagles, as well as the numerical rates of prey delivery to nestlings, and the differences in prey diversity between sexes, in nine nests in Ecuador. Males provided more prey to nestlings than females (227 vs. 99 prey items, respectively), and females hunted heavier prey than males (on average 1.19 vs. 0.95 kg, respectively). The overlap in captured prey between sexes was relatively high (O = 0.67), which suggests potential for competition. There was no difference between male and female black-and-chestnut eagles in either prey diversity or the composition of the prey species when considering the main prey items. However, the sexes differed in the prey items at lower biomass contributions. Males’ prey were primarily bird species from the orders Galliformes, Columbiformes, and Psittaciformes, while females’ prey were mostly mammal species from the orders Primates and Carnivora, and some passerine birds. Both sexes preferred arboreal species, but males hunted more scansorial and terrestrial prey. Our data suggest that sex-related differences in the eagle’s dietary contribution to nestlings likely result from parental role differentiation, rather than intersexual competition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conservation; Feeding Habits; Human-wildlife Conflict; Reversed Size Dimorphism; Animal; Diet; Eagle; Ecuador; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Nesting; Physiology; Predation; Sex Factor; Animals; Diet; Eagles; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Nesting Behavior; Predatory Behavior; Sex Factors","animal; diet; eagle; Ecuador; feeding behavior; female; male; nesting; physiology; predation; sex factor; Animals; Diet; Eagles; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Nesting Behavior; Predatory Behavior; Sex Factors","We thank the Ministerio del Ambiente, Agua y Transici\u00F3n Ecol\u00F3gica (MAATE) for research permits # 013-19-IC-FAU-DNB/MA, MAAE-ARSFC-2020-0715, and MAAE-ARSFC-2022-2102 to conduct this study in Ecuador.

This study addresses these gaps by assessing crocodile diversity, distribution, and conservation threats in Guinea-Bissau, where existing data is outdated. We used visual surveys, inquiries, molecular barcoding, camera trapping, and bibliographic reviews to investigate crocodile populations. Notably, we found evidence suggesting the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), previously thought extinct in West Africa since about 200 years, may persist in Guinea-Bissau’s Cacheu region. We also confirmed the presence of the West African crocodile (Crocodylus suchus) in major river basins and coastal lagoons, including the Bijagós Archipelago, and the West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus cf. tetraspis) in the southern mainland and the Bijagós Archipelago. Habitat loss and deliberate killings were identified as major threats. Standardized surveys and genetic sampling are essential to assess population size, connectivity, and genetic diversity, informing evolutionary studies and conservation planning. Conservation efforts should prioritize habitat protection through community-managed reserves and restoration initiatives. Additionally, engaging local communities to raise awareness and develop conflict mitigation strategies is crucial, particularly in areas with human-crocodile interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crocodylus Niloticus; Freshwater Biodiversity; Habitat Degradation; Human-wildlife Conflict; Non-invasive Genetic; West Africa; Animal; Biodiversity; Classification; Crocodilian; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Genetics; Guinea-bissau; Physiology; Alligators And Crocodiles; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem","animal; biodiversity; classification; crocodilian; ecosystem; environmental protection; genetics; Guinea-Bissau; physiology; Alligators and Crocodiles; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem","We would like to acknowledge the Guinea-Bissau governmental agency Instituto de Biodiversidade e \u00C1reas Protegidas (IBAP), namely the former director Dr. Justino Biai for fieldwork and sampling permits.
