"Effects of Climate Change on Arctic Species","Smith, J. et al.","This study examines the impact of warming temperatures on Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations in the Arctic. We also observed changes in Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) behavior and Ringed seal (Pusa hispida) distribution patterns. The research shows significant habitat loss affecting these key Arctic species.",2023
"Pollinator Decline in Agricultural Systems","Johnson, M. et al.","Our research investigates the decline of Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in agricultural areas. We found correlations with pesticide use affecting Bombus terrestris and other native bee species. The study also examined impacts on European honeybee populations.",2022
"Marine Ecosystem Changes","Brown, K. et al.","We studied changes in marine food webs, focusing on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population dynamics. The research also examined interactions with Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) feeding patterns and their impact on krill species distribution.",2023
